# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically:
- ‚úÖ Run tests on every push and pull request
- üê≥ Build and push Docker images to Docker Hub (on main branch only)

## Workflow Overview

### Test Job
Runs on every push and pull request:
1. Checks out code
2. Sets up Python 3.11
3. Installs Poetry
4. Caches dependencies for faster builds
5. Installs project dependencies
6. Runs pytest with coverage

### Build and Push Job
Runs only on pushes to `main` branch (after tests pass):
1. Checks out code
2. Sets up Docker Buildx
3. Logs in to Docker Hub
4. Extracts metadata (tags, labels)
5. Builds Docker image
6. Pushes to Docker Hub as `kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry`

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### 1. DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
Your Docker Hub username.

**Value:** `kaw393939`

### 2. DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
A Docker Hub access token (NOT your password).

**How to create:**
1. Go to https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
2. Click "New Access Token"
3. Give it a description (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
4. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### Adding Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add both secrets:
   - Name: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, Value: `kaw393939`
   - Name: `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, Value: `<your-token>`

## Docker Image Tags

Images are tagged with:
- `latest` - Latest build from main branch
- `main-<sha>` - Specific commit SHA from main
- `main` - Current main branch

**Example:**
```bash
# Pull latest image
docker pull kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry:latest

# Pull specific commit
docker pull kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry:main-abc1234

# Run the image
docker run -p 8001:8000 kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry:latest
```

## Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline

## Viewing Workflow Runs

1. Go to https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry/actions
2. Click on a workflow run to see details
3. Click on individual jobs to see logs

## Triggering Workflows

Workflows run automatically on:
- **Every push** to any branch (runs tests)
- **Every pull request** (runs tests)
- **Push to main** (runs tests + builds & pushes to Docker Hub)

## Build Cache

The workflow uses Docker layer caching to speed up builds:
- Cache stored as `kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry:buildcache`
- Significantly faster subsequent builds

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing
Check the test job logs to see which tests failed:
```bash
# Run tests locally first
poetry run pytest -v
```

### Docker Build Failing
- Check that Dockerfile is valid
- Test build locally:
```bash
docker build -t test .
```

### Docker Push Failing
- Verify secrets are set correctly
- Check Docker Hub token hasn't expired
- Ensure repository exists: https://hub.docker.com/r/kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry

### Secrets Not Working
- Secret names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Secrets are encrypted and can't be viewed after creation
- Delete and recreate if unsure

## Best Practices

‚úÖ Always run tests locally before pushing  
‚úÖ Keep Docker Hub tokens secure (never commit them)  
‚úÖ Review workflow logs after each push  
‚úÖ Use meaningful commit messages  
‚úÖ Create pull requests for major changes  

## Next Steps

After setting up secrets:
1. Push a commit to trigger the workflow
2. Watch it run at https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry/actions
3. Check Docker Hub for your image: https://hub.docker.com/r/kaw393939/docker_fastapi_poetry
