# HTTP Status Codes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the five categories of HTTP status codes
- Understand what each status code means
- Choose appropriate status codes for API responses
- Troubleshoot API issues using status codes

---

## What are HTTP Status Codes?

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that the server sends back to tell you how your request went. Think of them as the server's way of saying "here's what happened."

---

## The Five Categories

```
1xx - Informational  "Hold on, I'm working on it..."
2xx - Success        "Done! ‚úÖ"
3xx - Redirection    "Go look over there ‚Üí"
4xx - Client Error   "You messed up ‚ùå"
5xx - Server Error   "I messed up üí•"
```

---

## 2xx Success - Everything Worked!

### 200 OK
**Meaning:** Request succeeded, here's your data

**When to use:**
- GET requests that return data
- PUT/PATCH requests that update data
- Any successful operation

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/users/123

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

### 201 Created
**Meaning:** New resource successfully created

**When to use:**
- POST requests that create new resources

**Example:**
```http
POST /api/users

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /api/users/124

{
  "id": 124,
  "name": "Bob",
  "created_at": "2025-10-21T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 204 No Content
**Meaning:** Success, but no data to return

**When to use:**
- DELETE requests
- Updates that don't return data

**Example:**
```http
DELETE /api/users/123

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

---

## 3xx Redirection - Resource Moved

### 301 Moved Permanently
**Meaning:** Resource permanently moved to new URL

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/v1/users

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /api/v2/users
```

### 304 Not Modified
**Meaning:** Cached version is still valid

**When to use:**
- Response to conditional GET requests
- When content hasn't changed

---

## 4xx Client Errors - You Made a Mistake

These mean **you** (the client) did something wrong.

### 400 Bad Request
**Meaning:** Your request is malformed or invalid

**Common causes:**
- Invalid JSON syntax
- Missing required fields
- Wrong data types

**Example:**
```http
POST /api/users
{"name": "Alice"  // Missing closing brace

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{
  "error": "Invalid JSON syntax"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized
**Meaning:** You need to authenticate first

**Common causes:**
- Missing authentication token
- Invalid credentials
- Expired token

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/protected

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
{
  "error": "Authentication required"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden
**Meaning:** You're authenticated but don't have permission

**Example:**
```http
DELETE /api/admin/users

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Admin access required"
}
```

**401 vs 403:**
```
401: "Who are you?" (Need to login)
403: "I know who you are, but you can't do that" (Insufficient permissions)
```

### 404 Not Found
**Meaning:** Resource doesn't exist

**Common causes:**
- Wrong URL
- Resource was deleted
- Typo in endpoint

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/users/999

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

### 422 Unprocessable Entity
**Meaning:** Request is valid JSON but fails validation

**Example:**
```http
POST /api/users
{
  "name": "A",           // Too short
  "email": "not-an-email" // Invalid format
}

HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
{
  "errors": [
    {"field": "name", "message": "Must be at least 2 characters"},
    {"field": "email", "message": "Invalid email format"}
  ]
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests
**Meaning:** You're making requests too fast (rate limited)

**Example:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60

{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds"
}
```

---

## 5xx Server Errors - Server Made a Mistake

These mean the **server** has a problem.

### 500 Internal Server Error
**Meaning:** Something went wrong on the server

**Common causes:**
- Unhandled exceptions
- Code bugs
- Database connection failures

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/users

HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "error": "An unexpected error occurred"
}
```

### 502 Bad Gateway
**Meaning:** Server got invalid response from upstream server

**Common in:**
- Microservices architecture
- Proxy/load balancer scenarios

### 503 Service Unavailable
**Meaning:** Server temporarily unavailable

**Common causes:**
- Maintenance
- Overloaded server
- Service restart

**Example:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 300

{
  "error": "Service temporarily unavailable"
}
```

## Quick Reference Table

| Code | Name | Meaning | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| 200 | OK | Success | User data retrieved |
| 201 | Created | Resource created | New user created |
| 204 | No Content | Success, no data | User deleted |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request | Malformed JSON |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Need authentication | Missing token |
| 403 | Forbidden | No permission | Not admin |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource missing | User doesn't exist |
| 422 | Unprocessable | Validation failed | Invalid email |
| 500 | Server Error | Server problem | Database crash |

## Real-World Analogies

### The Restaurant Analogy

```
200 OK          = "Here's your meal, enjoy!"
201 Created     = "Your order is ready!"
204 No Content  = "Order cancelled successfully"
400 Bad Request = "Sorry, I can't read your handwriting"
401 Unauthorized= "You need a reservation"
403 Forbidden   = "Members only section"
404 Not Found   = "That dish isn't on our menu"
422 Unprocessable= "We can't make pizza with ice cream"
500 Server Error= "The kitchen is on fire!"
503 Unavailable = "We're closed for cleaning"
```

‚îú‚îÄ Yes
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Returning data? ‚Üí 200 OK
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Created something? ‚Üí 201 Created
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ No data to return? ‚Üí 204 No Content
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ No
   ‚îú‚îÄ Client's fault?
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Invalid request? ‚Üí 400 Bad Request
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Not logged in? ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ No permission? ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Not found? ‚Üí 404 Not Found
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Validation failed? ‚Üí 422 Unprocessable Entity
   ‚îÇ
   ‚îî‚îÄ Server's fault?
      ‚îú‚îÄ Code error? ‚Üí 500 Internal Server Error
      ‚îî‚îÄ Service down? ‚Üí 503 Service Unavailable
```

## Testing Status Codes with curl

```bash
# See status code with -i flag
curl -i http://localhost:8001/

# Output:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Mon, 21 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT
server: uvicorn
content-type: application/json

{"message":"Hello World"}

# Get only status code with -w flag
curl -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:8001/
# Output: 200

# Test 404
curl -i http://localhost:8001/nonexistent
# Output: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

## Common Patterns

### Successful CRUD Operations

```
CREATE (POST):   201 Created
READ (GET):      200 OK
UPDATE (PUT):    200 OK
DELETE (DELETE): 204 No Content
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

```json
// Good error response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "field": "email"
  }
}

// Better error response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Invalid email format",
        "value": "not-an-email"
      },
      {
        "field": "age",
        "message": "Must be at least 18",
        "value": 15
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting with Status Codes

### Getting 404s?
- Check your URL spelling
- Verify the resource exists
- Check API documentation

### Getting 401s?
- Are you sending authentication token?
- Is the token valid/not expired?
- Are you using correct authentication method?

### Getting 500s?
- Check server logs
- Look for stack traces
- Verify database connections

### Getting 422s?
- Check request body format
- Validate all required fields
- Check data types match expected values

---

## Practice Exercise

### Challenge: Identify Correct Status Codes

What status code should be returned in these scenarios?

1. User successfully logs in
2. Trying to access admin page without admin rights
3. Creating a new blog post
4. Deleting a comment
5. Requesting a user that doesn't exist
6. Sending invalid JSON
7. Database connection fails

**Answers:**
```
1. 200 OK (with auth token)
2. 403 Forbidden
3. 201 Created
4. 204 No Content
5. 404 Not Found
6. 400 Bad Request
7. 500 Internal Server Error
```
